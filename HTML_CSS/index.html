    <h1>Tornadoes</h1>
    <h3>What are they?</h3>
    <p>Tornadoes are <b class="emphasis">EXCLUSIVELY</b> formed on land. 
    They are a narrow, violenty rotating air column that extends from a thunderstorm from the sky to the ground.</p>
    <p>They are invisible untill it gathers enough dust and debri, or form a funnel of condensated water droplets and moisture. This happens because the pressure inside the tornado's vortex low, so the water vapour that's in the air condensates, creating the water droplets that form the visible funnel-shaped cloud.</p>
    <p>We rate them by how much damage and destruction they caused (human-built structures and vegetation). It is used the "<a href=""><i>Enhanced Fujita Scale</i></a>", it replaced the original "<a href=""><i>Fujita Scale</i></a>", to align better the winds speeds with the damange done by the Tornado. It incorporates 28 damage indicators (DI), each one varying from a range of degrees of damage (DoD).</p>
