        <h3>What are they?</h3>
        <p>Tornadoes are <b class="emphasis">EXCLUSIVELY</b> formed on land. 
        They are a narrow, violenty rotating air column that extends from a thunderstorm from the sky to the ground.</p>
        <p>They are invisible untill it gathers enough dust and debri, or form a funnel of condensated water droplets and moisture. This happens because the pressure inside the tornado's vortex low, so the water vapour that's in the air condensates, creating the water droplets that form the visible funnel-shaped cloud.</p>
        <p>We rate them by how much damage and destruction they caused (human-built structures and vegetation). It is used the "<a class="hyperlink" href=""><i>Enhanced Fujita Scale</i></a>", it replaced the original "<a class="hyperlink" href=""><i>Fujita Scale</i></a>", to align better the winds speeds with the damange done by the Tornado. It incorporates 28 damage indicators (DI), each one varying from a range of degrees of damage (DoD).</p>

        <h3>Types of Tornadoes</h3>
        <p>We have 2 types of tornadoes: <span>SUPERCELL</span> and <span>NON-SUPERCELL</span></p>

                <p class="type-explanation-text">A <b>SUPERCELL</b> tornado is a type of tornado that comes from a <b>SUPERCELL</b> storm. They are the most common and the most dangerous. There are many ways that cientists think a tornado can be formed in a supercell storm - one of them is when winds from oposite directions at different levels meet and create a rotation. For example, when a wind at ground level, slowed down by friction with the earth's surface, comes from the southwest at 5 mph (8 km/h). But higher up there's winds at 25 mph (40 km/h) coming from the west. This difference in wind speed and direction creates a horizontal spinning effect in the atmosphere, which can be tilted into a vertical position by strong updrafts within the supercell.</p>
